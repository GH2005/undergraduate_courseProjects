In a course called "Realtime Graphic design", I wrote this program with the help of the book "Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0". I did not actually "wrote" it, but assembled code and resources from the book and the Internet into one program. At that time, I could understand every line of code in the program well, but now I nearly know nothing about DirectX.

Roughly, what is in this super simple 3D program?
1. Window initialization and DirectX initialization;
2. Loading a mesh file (an object model);
3. Light sources;
4. A mobile camera;
5. A skybox;
6. Some basic Windows programming techniques required.
