Code I wrote on demand of course "Data Structures", including:
linked list (application: value evaluation of a one-variable polynomial, and product of two polynomials);
bidirectional stack;
Fibonacci Sequence (iteration version and recursion version);
Complete binary trees (sequencial and chaining representation, and traversal);
linked stack;
graph traversal;
odd-even sort.
