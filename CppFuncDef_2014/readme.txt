This is a parser and lexer for parsing a C++ function definition, which I worked out on demand of the course "Compilation Theory".
It is a C# project with ANTLR 4 plugin.
It accepts legitimate C++ function definition code where any number of lines of legitimate C++ code is allowed between the braceses, roughly.
If you understand Chinese, please refer to "说明.txt" for details.
