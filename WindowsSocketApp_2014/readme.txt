Code I wrote in the course "Computer Networking".
Originally achieved using Visual Studio 2013. Windows Socket 2.2 is required.

This Visual Studio Solution folder contains three sub-projects: Peer, Server, Client.
As the names suggest, I implemented both the Server/Client architecture and the P2P architecture:
1. With C/S, there are two features: ping request from Client to Server and file downloading from Server to Client.
2. With P2P, I made a simple live chat program.

If you understand Chinese, refer to "说明.txt" for more information.
