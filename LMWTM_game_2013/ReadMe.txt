"LMWTM" stands for "Little mouse walks the maze";
it is a game developed by Nan Wang and me on demand of the C++ Practice course in 2013 at Tianjin University;
Nan Wang was responsible for managing the background data structure using algorithms,
and I designed the whole program structure and the UI.
I tried my best to employ the MVC architecture, and utilized a class-encapsulated MFC framework.

The last compilation was done by Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 with update 3.
